# CC Libs
This repository contains a set of ComputerCraft librairies to use with ComputerCraft

## How to use?
for example:
```lua
os.loadAPI("logging")
```

### logging
I made this logging library because I needed good logging for my programs, this will probably get frequent updates!

### json
The JSON library wasn't made by me, [here](https://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/5854-json-api-v201-for-computercraft/) is the post of the original creator
